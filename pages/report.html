        <h1>Job Description</h1>
        <p>
          During the first four months of my internship at Electronic Arts (EA),
          I served as a C++ Software Engineer on the Client Team for the new
          FC24 game, working on both front-end and back-end features. My primary
          responsibility during this phase of my internship was centered around
          bug fixing within the Ultimate Team (UT) game mode. This task involved
          the identification, testing, and resolution of various bugs, each
          presenting unique challenges and valuable learning experiences. I
          worked extensively with C++, ActionScript, and XML in this capacity.
          As I became more immersed in the role of a Software Engineer, my
          responsibilities expanded to include redesigning aspects of the game,
          introducing new features and functionalities, and managing crash dump
          reports, which I found particularly intriguing. These reports
          represented errors in the codebase that led to game crashes during
          specific in-game actions. My role entailed identifying the source of
          the error and determining whether it originated within our team or
          elsewhere, necessitating appropriate communication and action. This
          experience greatly enhanced both my technical and interpersonal
          skills, as it involved a well-defined sequence of tasks. These
          experiences were like a big step forward in my learning as they
          provided insights into the company's workflow and the entire process
          of implementing changes into the mainstream game. <br /><br />
          Most of the skills needed for the job were learned during onboarding.
          This included becoming familiar with company software like Perforce,
          Jira, Slack, and Frostbite Drone, as well as participating in stand-up
          meetings and understanding the bug ticketing process. However, one
          critical skill I could directly apply from my school background was
          C++ programming. In the first two years of my education, we
          extensively covered C and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts,
          which made it relatively easy to transition to a programming language
          I had previously learned. Consequently, I was able to quickly enhance
          my proficiency in C++. Moreover, I leveraged this knowledge to pick up
          a new programming language, ActionScript, which was used by the
          company and proved to be highly beneficial.
        </p>

        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>
          The general goals I set for this work term revolved around building
          teamwork, problem-solving, and communication skills. However, I also
          established goals directly related to my tasks. Some of these tasks
          include learning the company's workflow, becoming proficient in
          company-related software, and building connections with all my team
          members.

                My primary objective as an intern at EA is to enhance my
                teamwork skills within a professional environment. At EA,
                teamwork is highly valued, and there is a strong emphasis on
                collaboration across all teams in the company. By working with a
                team of experts in this area, I am eager to gain new insights
                and ideas to further develop my teamwork abilities.
                Additionally, I have the opportunity to expand my teamwork
                skills by collaborating with individuals from different
                disciplines, such as the server team, which will help me broaden
                my network. I am excited to build upon my existing skills and

                    Now that I have successfully completed my first work term
                    with EA, I feel that I have achieved the goal of 'Teamwork'
                    quite effectively. I was able to establish meaningful
                    connections with a diverse range of team members, enabling
                    me to engage not only with Software Engineers but also with
                    designers, producers, and even server engineers. These
                    connections were instrumental in facilitating the successful
                    completion of my tasks and duties.

                    'Inter Fair.' These interactions provided valuable insights

                Problem-solving is an essential skill in my role as a software

                resolution. Therefore, my objective is to continuously develop
                my problem-solving abilities to a level where I can confidently
                and effectively address any issue that arises. By honing my
                problem-solving skills, I aim to enhance my capacity to tackle
                complex problems and find optimal solutions within the context
                of my role as a software engineer at EA. <br />

                    During the initial phase of my internship, I believe I've
                    made substantial progress toward this objective. As a
                    Software Engineer on the team, I successfully resolved
                    multiple assigned bugs and gradually took on more complex
                    tasks. I started with straightforward front-end bugs related
                    to screen fonts and images and have now progressed to
                    tackling back-end bugs that pertain to the core data of the
                    FC game itself. So far, I've completed over 30 bugs for the
                    game.<br />

                    Through these bug-fixing tasks, I've developed a wide range

                    codebase to locate specific code segments, exploring various
                    approaches to issue resolution, and identifying reliable
                    resources for seeking assistance in bug resolution. These

                    After the first four months of my internship, I have already
                    made substantial progress in pursuit of this goal.
                    Initially, initiating conversations with various team
                    members posed a challenge for me, primarily due to
                    uncertainty about whom to approach with specific inquiries.
                    However, through interactions with my manager and technical
                    lead over time, I've gained insights into the distinct roles
                    each team member plays. This has enabled me to discern the
                    appropriate individuals to seek assistance from and when to
                    do so. The consistent presence of team members on Slack
                    greatly facilitated this process. By utilizing dedicated
                    channels tailored to specific topics, I maximized my
                    engagement with discussions. Additionally, I successfully
                    established bi-weekly meetings with my manager, ensuring our
                    alignment and maintaining transparency regarding my ongoing
                    tasks. This practice has proven instrumental in keeping both
                    of us well-informed.

                    provided me with valuable firsthand experience in an office
                    setting, allowing me the opportunity to network and
                    personally interact with team members. It was an

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          This has been my first co-op experience, and I must say it's been a
          fantastic opportunity to get a glimpse of the kind of work I might be
          doing in the future. Working at Electronic Arts (EA) has been a real
          learning experience. They've not only helped me improve my coding

        <h1>Job Description</h1>
        <p>
          During my 8-month internship at Electronic Arts (EA), I worked as a
          C++ Software Engineer on the Client Team for the new FC24 game. I was
          involved in both front-end and back-end features. For the first 6
          months, my main task was bug fixing within the Ultimate Team (UT) game
          mode. I identified, tested, and resolved various bugs using C++,
          ActionScript, and XML. As I grew in my role, I redesigned game
          aspects, introduced new features, and managed crash dump reports.
          These reports highlighted codebase errors causing game crashes. My job
          was to find the error source and its origin, which improved my
          technical and interpersonal skills. This experience was a big step in
          my learning, giving me insights into the company’s workflow and how
          changes are implemented into the game. <br /><br />
          Most of the skills needed for the job were learned during onboarding.
          This included getting familiar with company software like Perforce,
          Jira, Slack, and Frostbite Drone, participating in stand-up meetings,
          and understanding the bug ticketing process. However, one important
          skill I could apply from my school background was C++ programming. In
          the first two years of my education, we covered C and Object-Oriented
          Programming (OOP) concepts extensively, which made it easier to
          transition to a programming language I had previously learned. As a
          result, I was able to quickly improve my proficiency in C++. Moreover,
          I used this knowledge to learn a new programming language,
          ActionScript, which was used by the company and proved to be very
          useful. <br /><br />
          For the last 2 months of the internship, we moved into pre-production
          and improvement staging tasks. So my job role changed from fixing bugs
          and game crashes to developing new scripts and features that can be
          implemented in the next game cycle to improve the game. Also, as a
          task I wanted to work on, I took my own initiative to tackle a
          challenge I faced during my internship which can benefit the team.
          This was to develop an automated script that can help new software
          engineers find screen code much faster in our large code base. During
          the FC 24 cycle, as a new SE intern on the team, I found it quite
          challenging to quickly adapt to the codebase and locate the relevant
          code for the current screen in order to resolve bugs. This led to a
          significant waste of time when trying to address these issues.
          <br /><br />
          The main reason for this challenge is the sheer size of the codebase
          at EA, which requires a lot of time to fully understand the workflow.
          As a result, it makes it hard to grasp the concept of finding code in
          the early stages of onboarding. To solve this problem, a script is
          currently being developed, which will be a valuable tool for
          pinpointing the code responsible for specific screens as accurately as
          possible. This tool is expected to be very helpful for new SEs on the
          FUT Client Team, but it will also be available for use by experienced
          SEs who may find it useful in their work.
        </p>

        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>
          In the second half of my internship, I not only developed additional
          goals specific to my work but also refined some from the previous
          half. One goal I chose to expand upon is my teamwork skills, where I
          aim to contribute to decision-making processes and bring forth
          innovative ideas. The other two goals, Technical Learning and Problem
          Solving & Engagement, are new. These goals will not only facilitate my
          understanding of the technical tools used by the team but also enable
          me to effect positive changes for the Software Engineers. Now, let’s
          delve deeper into these goals!
        </p>

        <ul class="goal">
          <li class="curved-arrow">
            <strong>
              Goal 1: Professional & Ethical Behaviour – Teamwork
            </strong>
            <ul>
              <li class="arrow">
                As I approach my second term here at EA, I have gradually
                established meaningful connections with a diverse range of team
                members. This has enabled me to effectively engage with
                designers, producers, and server engineers, facilitating the
                successful completion of my assigned tasks. Looking ahead to the
                latter half of my coop, I am eager to elevate my involvement by
                engaging in decision-making processes and contributing
                innovative ideas to my team. I am motivated to make a
                substantial impact on game production and future planning.

                  <li class="checkmark">
                    As I approach the end of my internship at EA, I believe I
                    have effectively achieved my goal of enhancing Teamwork. As
                    we transitioned into the pre-production and improvement
                    stages, I actively participated in discussions about
                    potential enhancements to the game. This involvement allowed
                    me to contribute my own ideas, truly making me feel like a
                    part of the team. Additionally, I proposed an improvement
                    task as a side project aimed at boosting the efficiency of
                    the Software Engineers on the team. This project has enabled
                    me to connect with various new team members leading to new
                    discussions actively engaging me the development cycle.

            <strong> Goal 2: Problem Solving & Engagement </strong>
            <ul>
              <li class="arrow">
                As the FC24 project is nearing its completion, I am eager to
                transition into a more focused role dedicated to working on a
                side project aimed at enhancing the efficiency of our Software
                Engineers in various aspects. This shift will prove advantageous
                for both the company and me, allowing me to delve deeper into
                our company's workflow and, hopefully, make a significant and
                beneficial impact. <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li class="arrow">
                Reflection:

                  <li class="checkmark">
                    In terms of this goal, I would estimate that I have achieved
                    about three-quarters of it. The project I conceptualized and
                    chose to undertake involves developing a Python script to
                    speed up the process of locating screen code for the game.
                    This, in turn, is expected to enhance the engineering
                    efficiency of the team. I have made substantial progress on
                    this project, learning a lot of new aspects about
                    programming and the code base at EA, thereby expanding my
                    knowledge base significantly.<br />
                  </li>
                  <li class="checkmark">
                    However, I consider this goal to be only three-quarters
                    complete because the project is still in the development
                    phase. There are a few stages that are particularly
                    time-consuming and have currently been put on hold. Despite
                    this, the project is structured in such a way that it can be
                    easily resumed and brought to completion soon. This
                    experience has not only provided me with valuable technical
                    skills but also offered insights into project management and
                    the importance of adaptability when facing unexpected
                    challenges. <br />

              </li>

            <strong> Goal 3: Technical Learning </strong>
            <ul>
              <li class="arrow">
                My primary goal during my 8-month co-op at EA is to gain
                practical hands-on experience across a wide range of technical
                aspects within the field. As I enter the midpoint of my
                engagement, having already dedicated 4 months to the team, I've
                had the opportunity to immerse myself in a diverse array of
                technical tasks. These tasks have required me to utilize various
                tools and concepts to develop effective solutions. My goal is to

                    Reflecting on my internship at EA, I can confidently say
                    that I have made significant strides towards achieving my
                    set goals. One of the key challenges I embraced was tackling
                    more complex bugs as we neared the game’s launch date. This
                    was a demanding period with tight deadlines, which taught me
                    the invaluable skill of working under pressure.

                  <li class="checkmark">
                    I took on the responsibility of contributing to the
                    resolution of over five bugs for each patch fix. This not
                    only honed my problem-solving skills but also gave me a
                    sense of accomplishment and contribution to the team’s
                    success. Interestingly, I found myself dealing more with C++
                    based bugs than front-end ones. This experience broadened my
                    technical skills and deepened my understanding of the game’s
                    backend operations. Despite the challenges, I am proud of my
                    progress towards this goal and look forward to applying
